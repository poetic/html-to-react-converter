# TODO

- stage 1: convert files into react components
  - import all the config files, parse as config ( not part of plugin )
  - for each hrc/pages/[PageName].json, we generate components in destination
  - provide hooks in different levels so that we have a plugin systems
    - each component
  - plugins:
    - className
    - style
    - props (later)

- stage 2: add container components and resolve dependencies

- stage 3: change urls for react router
